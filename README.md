**Overview**
  This project aims to develop a binary classifier that can predict the likelihood of applicants achieving success if they receive funding from Alphabet Soup. The project will utilize the features present in the given dataset and employ diverse machine learning methods to train and assess the model's performance. The objective is to optimize the model in order to attain an accuracy score surpassing 75%.

  **Data Preprocessing**
  
     The model aims to predict the success of applicants if they receive funding. This is indicated by the IS_SUCCESSFUL column in the dataset which is the target variable of  the model. The feature variables are every column other than the target variable and the non-relevant variables such as EIN and names. The features capture relevant information about the data and can be used in predicting the target variables, the non-relevant variables that are neither targets nor features will be drop from the dataset to avoid potential noise that might confuse the model.
During preprocessing, I implemented binning/bucketing for rare occurrences in the APPLICATION_TYPE and CLASSIFICATION columns. Subsequently, I transformed categorical data into numeric data using the one-hot encoding technique. I split the data into separate sets for features and targets, as well as for training and testing. Lastly, I scaled the data to ensure uniformity in the data distribution.
